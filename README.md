# Sparta_Global_Csharp_game

This Project was conducted in 4 days, using Microsoft visual Studio in the WPF app. This game was based on the traditional connect Four priciples but on an 8x8 grid, to make the difficultly higher and to try and implement the SOLID Principles while enjoying a decent game.
To win the user must pick a postition on the grid and drop their token to the bottom, while trying to connect 4 tokens for a victory, each coin drop swaps between player 1 and player2 represented as black and pink respectively.
To initaiate the game the START GAME button must be preesed to display the grid, a restart button is located next to this button for reinialising the game.
